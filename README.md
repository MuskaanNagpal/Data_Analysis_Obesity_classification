Obesity is a critical health concern worldwide, presenting multifaceted challenges in healthcare. Influenced by an intricate interplay of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, obesity contributes significantly to various health issues, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and overall diminished quality of life. Understanding and addressing this complex problem necessitate advanced analytical approaches, particularly in the era of healthcare data abundance.This project centers on applying supervised learning methods, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to tackle the intricate challenge of classifying obesity levels in individuals from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. These algorithms are trained on a diverse set of features encompassing aspects such as eating habits, physical condition, and genetic predispositions.

This study focuses on classifying obesity levels in individuals from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, using a dataset of 17 attributes. The NObesity variable categorizes data into seven classes. The dataset's unique composition, with 77% synthetically generated and 23% directly collected, adds complexity to the analysis. The paper employs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and hypothesis testing, aiming to optimize classification accuracy. Comparative analysis between SVM and KNN algorithms highlights improved accuracy. This research contributes insights into obesity classification factors, incorporating statistical rigor through hypothesis testing. 

In conclusion, this project delved into the task of classifying obesity levels in individuals from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. Through meticulous data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and strategic preprocessing steps, the dataset was refined for modeling. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) emerged as robust models, achieving accuracies of 96.17% and 83.73%, respectively, following hyperparameter optimization.
The application of hypothesis testing revealed significant associations between smoking status and obesity levels, as well as variations in physical activity frequency among different obesity categories. The comprehensive evaluation included confusion matrix visualizations and ROC curve analyses, providing a nuanced understanding of model performance.
This project contributes valuable insights into lifestyle factors influencing obesity and underscores the potential applications of machine learning in healthcare. Future research could explore additional features and advanced techniques to further enhance predictive capabilities. Overall, this study advances our understanding of obesity classification and its determinants.
